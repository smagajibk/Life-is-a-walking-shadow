========================

Out... Out... A breif candle, life is a walking shadow, a poor player may strust and frest his hour upon the stage, and than is heard no more, it is a tale told by an idiot ful of sound and fury signifying nothing.But he who refuse to lie down under the shadow of the failure, he will be a wonderful soccer and even fifa will be learned by him.
